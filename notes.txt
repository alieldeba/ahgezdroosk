Subscriptions :

say that we want to take from every student 10 L.E
and we have a starting plan for 300 student,
so 300 * 10 = 3,000

if teacher takes from every student 150 L.E minimum,
so teacher takes 300 * 150 = 45,000 per month

then teacher will take 42,000 per month after subscription this means that :
he will take 140 L.E from every student and not 150 L.E

we can also make a discount for big subscriptions
for example instead of 3,000 we can make it 2,550

------

if the teacher has a huge number of students over than the planes for example 10,000 student
so we can make him make a custom plane for him that named "pay as you go"

for example the website will ask for him to enter students number
and if number exceeds say "500" student he will take a discount

discount will be made by a calculating algorithm
